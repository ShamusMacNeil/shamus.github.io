    <h1>Collecting and Reading Manga</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Manga is basically the Japanese version of comic books. The major difference being in story telling, art-style, and the way you read each page.</p>

    <p>I got into Manga collecting during the 2020 pandemic. I stumbled across some youtube videos of people with large collections, and thought how awesomed they looked.At the time I hadnt realized how much money one must spend in order to have an extravagant collection.</p>
